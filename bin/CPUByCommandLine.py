This script is designed to get CPU-time by process command line. It is used
after running:
wpaexporter -i trace.etl -profile CPUUsageByCommandLine.wpaProfile

Running this wpaexporter command creates two .csv files, one mapping from
process to command line and another mapping from process to CPU usage.
Due to PID reuse the results are not guaranteed but will be mostly accurate.
This was initially written in order to analyze CPU usage by Python scripts in
Chromium's build.
