A few things can be observed about the data.

The Pmc data takes a while to get going - there can be thousands of CSwitch events
before the first Pmc event. Awesome.

The Pmc events are cumulative and per-processor. This explains why they increase over the
duration of the trace, but not monotonically. They only increase monotonically if you look
at them on a particular CPU.

The Pmc events are associated with the following event. This can be seen in the CSwitch at TimeStamp
64704. This CSwitch is on CPU 2 and the following Pmc has a BranchInstructions count of 7077, which
is incompatible with the previous CSwitch which is also on CPU 2.

The CSwitch events are when a thread *starts* executing. So, you don't know what counts to associate
with a timeslice until the *next* context switch on that CPU. So...

When a Pmc event is seen, look for a CSwitch event on the next line. If this is not the first Pmc/CSwitch
pair for this CPU (see column 16) then calculate the deltas for all of the Pmc counters and add those
deltas to the process listed in the Old Process Name ( PID) column (column 8).

Sometimes there will be an Error: message inbetween the Pmc and CSwitch lines. Ignore those, but don't
be too forgiving about what you parse or else you may end up calculating garbage results.

Example:

                    Pmc,    2428274,         84, 45813769, 2146039
Error: Description for thread state (9) could not be found. Thread state array out of date!!
                CSwitch,    2428274,           System (   4),         84,   23,   -1,         220,        0,        csrss.exe ( 628),        732,   14,   -1,  <out of range>,  WrProcessInSwap, Swapable,     19,   2,   4,   68552704,    0,    0
