@rem Start tracing with context switches and with a few CPU performance
@rem counters being recorded for each context switch.
tracelog.exe -start pmc_counters -f pmc_counter_test.etl -eflag CSWITCH+PROC_THREAD+LOADER -PMC BranchMispredictions,BranchInstructions:CSWITCH
@if %errorlevel% equ 0 goto started
@echo Make sure you are running from an administrator command prompt
@exit /b
:started

@rem Counters can also be associated with other events such as PROFILE - just
@rem change both occurrences of CSWITCH to PROFILE. But the parsing code will have
@rem to be updated to make it meaningful.

@rem Other available counters can be found by running "tracelog -profilesources Help"
@rem and on my machine I see:
@rem Timer
@rem TotalIssues
@rem BranchInstructions
@rem CacheMisses
@rem BranchMispredictions
@rem TotalCycles
@rem UnhaltedCoreCycles
@rem InstructionRetired - shows same results as TotalIssues
@rem UnhaltedReferenceCycles
@rem LLCReference
@rem LLCMisses
@rem BranchInstructionRetired - shows same results as BranchInstructions
@rem BranchMispredictsRetired - not significantly different from BranchMispredictions

@rem @echo Run your scenario and then press Enter when finished
